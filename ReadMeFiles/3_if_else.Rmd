## if Statements

An `if` statement tells R to do a certain task for a certain case. In English you would say something like, "If this is true, do that." In R, you would say:

```r
if (this) {
  that
}
```

The `this` object should be a logical test or an R expression that evaluates to a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If `this` evaluates to `TRUE`, R will run all of the code that appears between the braces that follow the `if` statement (i.e., between the `{` and `}` symbols). If `this` evaluates to `FALSE`, R will skip the code between the braces without running it.

For example, you could write an `if` statement that ensures some object, `num`, is positive. If `num < 0` is `TRUE`, R will multiply `num` by negative one, which will make `num` positive: 

```{r}
# If num is negative, make it positive
num = -2
if (num < 0) {   
  num = num * -1
}
num
```

If `num < 0` is `FALSE`, R will do nothing and `num` will remain as it is:

```{r}
num = 4
if (num < 0) {
  num = num * -1
}
num
## 4
```

The condition of an `if` statement must evaluate to a *single* `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the condition creates a vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s (which is easier to make than you may think), your `if` statement will print a warning message and use only the first element of the vector. Remember that you can condense vectors of logical values to a single `TRUE` or `FALSE` with the functions `any` and `all`.

You don't have to limit your `if` statements to a single line of code; you can include as many lines as you like between the braces. For example, the following code uses many lines to ensure that `num` is positive. The additional lines print some informative statements if `num` begins as a negative number. R will skip the entire code block—`print` statements and all—if `num` begins as a positive number:

```{r}
num = -1
if (num < 0) {
  print("Uh-oh! num is negative.")
  num = num * -1
  print("Now num is positive.")
}
num
```

#### Exercise 3.1

Let's say you took someone's temperature and you want to first evaluate whether or not they have a fever. If they DO have a fever, claculate how different their temperature is from the median human temperature of 98.6 and print out the answer. Also, if they DO have a fever, evaluate whether the fever is high > 101 and if it is, print out a warning message. This will require a set of nested `if()` statements. Test your code with a temperature that is not a fever (`temp = 98.4`), that is a low fever (`temp = 99.5`) and that is a high fever (`temp = 102.1`).

## else Statements

`if` statements tell R what to do when your condition is _true_, but you can also tell R what to do when the condition is _false_. `else` is a counterpart to `if` that extends an `if` statement to include a second case. In English, you would say, "If this is true, do plan A; else do plan B." In R, you would say:

```r
if (this) {
  Plan A
} else {
  Plan B
}
```

When `this` evaluates to `TRUE`, R will run the code in the first set of braces, but not the code in the second. When `this` evaluates to `FALSE`, R will run the code in the second set of braces, but not the first. 

For example, let's use an if/else statement to notify a student whether they are passing or failing a class. 

```{r}
grade = 83

if(grade > 60){
  print("You passed!")
}else{
  print("You failed...")
}
```

If your situation has more than two mutually exclusive cases, you can string multiple `if` and `else` statements together by adding a new `if` statement immediately after `else`. For example:

```{r}
a = 1
b = 1
if (a > b) {
  print("A wins!")
} else if (a < b) {
  print("B wins!")
} else {
  print("Tie.")
}
```

R will work through the `if` conditions until one evaluates to `TRUE`, then R will ignore any remaining `if` and `else` clauses in the tree. If no conditions evaluate to `TRUE`, R will run the final `else` statement.

If two `if` statements describe mutually exclusive events, it is better to join the `if` statements with an `else if` than to list them separately. This lets R ignore the second `if` statement whenever the first returns a `TRUE`, which saves work.

### Exercise 3.2

Let's say you have the number of donuts your Dad bought on Sunday stored in variable `n_donuts`. Write an if/else chain to print out a statement that states whether Dad bought less than a dozen, a dozen (12), a baker's dozen (13) or more than a baker's dozen.

## ifelse()

A related function that is very useful is `ifelse`. This works just like an if/else combination that we saw earlier, but condenses it into a single line of code. This function takes three arguments: a logical and two possible answers. If the logical is `TRUE`, the value in the second argument is returned and if `FALSE`, the value in the third argument is returned. Here is an example:

```{r}
# Calculate reciprocals
a = 0
ifelse(a != 0, 1/a, NA)
```

The function is particularly useful because it works on vectors. It examines each entry of the logical vector and returns elements from the vector provided in the second argument, if the entry is `TRUE`, or elements from the vector provided in the third argument, if the entry is `FALSE`.

```{r}
a = c(0, 1, 2, -4, 5)
reciprocals = ifelse(a != 0, 1/a, NA)
cbind(a, reciprocals)
```

### Exercise 3.3

Perhaps in a dataset that you are using, the number `-999` is used to indicate a missing value (this is super common). To take advantage of R's intuitive handling of missing values (in math equations, plotting, etc.) you should replace those elements with `NA`. Use the ifelse() statement to replace all of the `-999` values in the `data` vector with `NA`. Then use an if/else chain to print out a statement about whether there are any `NA`s in the `data` variable. It may help to use functions we covered earlier like `any()` and `is.na()`.

```{r}
data = c(1,3,5,-999,2,-999,8)
```
