### Unit 2: Climate
#### Lesson 1: Melting Ice Sheets
#### Skills: read data, line plot, bar plot, saving plots, confidence intervals, indexing, arithmetic

***

**Don't forget to fork the Unit 2 GitHub repository** 

https://github.com/MSCI-709-2025/unit_2_climate 

Fork the repository to your own GitHub profile. From there, clone the forked repository and create a new RStudio project with version control called unit_2_climate on your local computer associated with this GitHub repo. Now you have access to all of the scripts, data and documentation files in the unit_2 class repo. I would recommend creating new `.R` files in your local RProject directory (i.e. the local version of your unit_2 repository) to type in the commands that we go over in class as you follow along. This gives you practice typing out code, and gives you the comfort to try new things without being afraid that you'll "mess up" your copy of the tutorial. You can always refer back to the lesson tutorial that I wrote, which is sitting right in your local directory. As you follow along in your own script (or even the `.Rmd` tutorial files) you can insert your code for the in-class exercises right in the middle of the scripts. When you make changes to the repository by adding new scripts or editing the existing scripts, don't forget to Commit and Push out your changes to your GitHub repo. Remember, those changes won't show up in the class repository, they'll only show up in **your** forked branch of the repository in your own GitHub profile.

#### Explore NASA melting ice sheet data

- Data description: <http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/>

The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet mass loss data is collected by NASA's GRACE satellites. This is a pair of satellites that orbit the Earth together at a distance of about 220 km apart to sense gravity anomalies. When the leading satellite orbits over a part of Earth with slightly stronger gravity, it is pulled ahead a bit faster. Then when it passes the high-gravity area, the satellite slows down again. The distance between the two satellites is consantly measured with a microwave ranging system, and this distance, combined with precise GPS measurements for each satellite in the pair, can be used to generate a map of Earth's gravity field. The melting of ice sheets on land is correlated with a decline in the gravity anomaly over the ice sheet as the ice mass melts and redistributes across the ocean basin.

#### Agenda:

- Construct the necessary R code to import this data set as a `data.frame` object.
- Examine the data set: what are the columns and units? Where do the numbers come from? 
- What is the uncertainty in measurement? Resolution of the data? Interpretation of missing values?
- Plot the data and describe the trends you observe.

Go to the website and register yourself as a NASA Earthdata user. From there you can click on the data and download it. If a pop-up doesn't show up when you click on the data, then in your web browser, go to `File -> Save page as -> and save it as a text file` in your Rproj folder in a directory called `/data`.

#### Read in and explore data

Use `read.table()` to read in the `.txt` data. There are 3 columns, the decimal date, the mass loss (in Gigatonnes) and one sigma (i.e. one standard deviation in Gigatonnes). We use the default separator `sep=""` which distinguishes column data by looking for white space. We skip the first 31 lines of the `.txt` file because that's all header (metadata). We manually code the column names after reading the header.

```{r}
ant_ice_loss = read.table("data/antarctica_mass_200204_202408.txt", skip=31, sep="", header = FALSE, col.names = c("decimal_date", "mass_Gt", "sigma_Gt")) # Antarctica ice mass loss
grn_ice_loss = read.table("data/greenland_mass_200204_202408.txt", skip=31, sep="", header = FALSE, col.names = c("decimal_date", "mass_Gt", "sigma_Gt")) # Greenland ice mass loss
```

Explore the data. See how it appears in the Environment pane (upper right corner of RStudio)? You can click on it here, or use the `View()` function to open it up in a spreadsheet inside RStudio. 

```{r}
# View(grn_ice_loss)
head(ant_ice_loss)
head(grn_ice_loss)
dim(ant_ice_loss)
summary(ant_ice_loss)
```

Plot the data using a formula `y ~ x`

```{r}
# Plot Antarctic ice mass loss. 
# plot(x=ant_ice_loss$decimal_date, y=ant_ice_loss$mass_Gt, ylab="Antarctica Mass Loss (Gt)") # ?plot.default
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss, ylab="Antarctica Mass Loss (Gt)") #  ?plot.formula

# Plot Greenland ice mass loss
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss, ylab="Greenland Mass Loss (Gt)")

# Plot both together as lines
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss, ylab="Ice Sheet Mass Loss (Gt)", type='l') 
lines(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss, col='red') 
```

The plot window is sized to capture the range of the data originally called, which in this case was the Antarctica ice loss. When we added the Greenland mass loss data to the plot, it extended outside the bounds of the plot window. Let's manually set the limits on the y-axis so we can see the whole Greenland time series.

```{r}
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss, ylab="Antarctica Mass Loss (Gt)", type='l', ylim=range(grn_ice_loss$mass_Gt)) +
lines(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss, type='l', col='red') 
```

Note how we can use the `+` to link multiple plots together to print to the same window and have R read the commands as though they were a single line of code.

From the website and from our scatter plot, we know that there was a gap between NASA Grace satellite missions from 2017-06-10 to 2018-06-14. Rather than have our plot function draw a line straight across the gap (which looks like we collected data when we didn't), we can break up the line into segments. I'm going to force R's plot() functions to note the gap in the data by inserting an `NA` into the data.frame at the start of 2018. Then let's add in grey shaded polygons behind it to show the uncertainty

```{r}
#Create data.frame with an NA between the GRACE missions. Column names must match so it will merge with ant and grn data
data_break = data.frame(decimal_date=2018.0, mass_Gt=NA, sigma_Gt=NA)
data_break

#Add NA data point to the Antarctica ice trends data frame
ant_ice_loss_with_NA = rbind(ant_ice_loss, data_break) # Merge ant_ice_loss data frame with our NA point
tail(ant_ice_loss_with_NA) # Our NA value in 2018 is now the last row of our data frame
order(ant_ice_loss_with_NA$decimal_date) # Use order() to list the indices of the data after its sorted from smallest to biggest
ant_ice_loss_with_NA = ant_ice_loss_with_NA[order(ant_ice_loss_with_NA$decimal_date),] # Reorder the data frame, sorting by date

#Repeat with Greenland data.frame
grn_ice_loss_with_NA = rbind(grn_ice_loss, data_break) # Merge grn_ice_loss data frame with our NA point
grn_ice_loss_with_NA = grn_ice_loss_with_NA[order(grn_ice_loss_with_NA$decimal_date),]

plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, ylab="Antarctica Mass Loss (Gt)", type='l', ylim=range(grn_ice_loss_with_NA$mass_Gt, na.rm=TRUE)) +
lines(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', col='red') 
```

NASA provided sigma, or one standard deviation, uncertainty data, which represents 68% of uncertainty. (Note in the header, they call it "1-sigma", but this doesn't mean "one minus the standard deviation", it means "one standard deviation"). However, in science, sometimes we show errors as "2-sigma", where 2 X sigma represents 95% uncertainty. We can plot 95% confidence intervals around the data by adding and subtracting 2*sigma from the mass loss estimates

```{r}
head(ant_ice_loss_with_NA)
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, ylab="Antarctica Mass Loss (Gt)", xlab="Year", type='l', lwd=2) +
lines((mass_Gt+2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed') +
lines((mass_Gt-2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed') 
```

***

### Exercise 1.1:

Create the same time series figure with 95% confidence intervals for the Greenland ice sheet mass loss.

***

### Saving plots to hard drive

Now we can combine our Antarctic and Greenland time series plots into the same plot and save our nice figure:

```{r}
pdf('figures/ice_mass_trends.pdf', width=7, height=5)
plot(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, ylab="Ice Sheet Mass Loss (Gt)", xlab="Year", type='l', ylim=range(grn_ice_loss_with_NA$mass_Gt, na.rm=TRUE), lwd=2) +
lines((mass_Gt+2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed') +
lines((mass_Gt-2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=ant_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed') +
lines(mass_Gt ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', col='red', lwd=2) +
lines((mass_Gt+2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed', col="red") +
lines((mass_Gt-2*sigma_Gt) ~ decimal_date, data=grn_ice_loss_with_NA, type='l', lty='dashed', col="red") 
dev.off()
```

Let's make a bar plot showing the difference in ice mass loss for Antarctica and Greenland:

```{r}
# Largest observed decrease in ice mass loss in Antarctica:
min(ant_ice_loss$mass_Gt)

# Barplot of largest observed ice loss in Antarctica and Greenland
barplot(height=c(min(ant_ice_loss$mass_Gt), min(grn_ice_loss$mass_Gt)))

# Flip to negative to positive, add x-axis labels, add more tick marks on y-axis, add y-axis title
barplot(height=c(min(ant_ice_loss$mass_Gt)*(-1), min(grn_ice_loss$mass_Gt)*(-1)), names.arg=c("Antarctica","Greenland"), ylim=c(0,6000), ylab="Ice loss in Gt")
```

***

### Exercise 1.2:

Calculate the average annual ice loss (a.k.a. the annual rate of ice loss) for each ice sheet by dividing the change in ice lost from the beginning to the end of the time series by the total time that passed. Then display the ice loss rates in a bar graph. Save the bar graph into the `figures/` directory in this repo.
